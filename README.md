## The task
We need to write a simple messaging application that would allow two people to exchange text messages using a web interface. It can be as simple as window with the chat history and the text input to send new messages.

## The scope
We don't need to make the UI beautiful (however, that surely helps). The primary focus should be on the logic, application structure, and sticking to programming best practices.

## API
The "backend engineers" have provided us with the basic API. In our case it is just a mock located in `src/api-mock/api.ts`. We as the frontend engineers can influence the API decisions made by the backend team. If we think that we need a better API, we can edit the mocks to make the API more suited to our task (as if we asked the backend team to do that).

## Testing
Does something need testing? What, why, and how?

## Communication
Think aloud! This help the interviewer understand your thought process and help you along the way.

## Resources
You are absolutely encouraged to use whatever resources you need. Here are just a few:
- [React docs](https://react.dev/reference/react)
- [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)
- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/intro.html)
- [Jest](https://jestjs.io/)
- [React testing library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/)
